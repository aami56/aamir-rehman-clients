Best new functions to add (ranked)
1) Auto monthly invoice generation (bulk)
Right now dashboard has a placeholder for this (TODO). Add a function that auto-creates invoices for all active clients each month in one click (or by scheduler).
Why it helps: saves hours every month.

2) Payment reminders (WhatsApp + Email automation)
You already have invoice sharing in invoice tab; next step is automatic reminders for unpaid/partial invoices at set days (e.g., 3rd, 7th, 15th).
Why it helps: improves collection rate.

3) Recurring billing templates per client
You already track month/year billing records and monthly service charge. Add recurring billing profiles (amount, due date, tax, discount) so each cycle is auto-prepared.
Why it helps: less manual billing data entry.

4) Real database persistence (Postgres) instead of memory
Current storage is in-memory (MemStorage), so data is not durable across restarts. Add DB-backed storage implementation and switch runtime storage to it.
Why it helps: production-safe reliability.

5) Authentication + multi-user roles
You already have passport, passport-local, and session-store dependencies but no active auth flow in routes. Add login/logout and roles (owner, accountant, manager).
Why it helps: security + team usage.

6) Invoice due dates + late fee rules
Billing has month/year/isPaid/paidAmount and notes, but no due-date/late-fee engine yet. Add automatic late fee and “days overdue” status. 
Why it helps: encourages timely payment.

7) Payment method tracking + reconciliation dashboard
You already store paymentMethod and paidDate in billing. Build reconciliation view:

paid by method (bank/cash/stripe),

pending aging buckets (0-15 / 16-30 / 30+ days).
Why it helps: better financial control.

8) Campaign performance ingestion + ROI scoring
Campaign schema already has performance JSON and platform/budget fields. Add connectors or manual metric import and auto ROI score per client.
Why it helps: proves your value to clients.

9) Task/reminder system tied to client notes
You already have note type/priority/dueDate/isCompleted. Add “Today’s tasks” view + overdue reminder notifications.
Why it helps: follow-ups become systematic.

10) File management upgrades
You have upload/list/delete with metadata. Add:

secure file download endpoint,

file categories (contract/invoice/creative),

preview links and expiration tokens.
Why it helps: better document organization.

11) Public invoice improvements
Public invoice route is already available. Add:

signed token in URL,

optional expiry,

“Pay now” button (Stripe/PayPal link).
Why it helps: faster and safer payment collection.

12) Data import tools (CSV clients + billing import)
You already support export CSV and settings JSON import/export patterns. Add import flows for clients and billing history with validation preview.
Why it helps: easier migration from spreadsheets.
